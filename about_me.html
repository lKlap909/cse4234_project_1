      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Logan Klaproth. I was born in San Antonio, Texas, but grew up in Melbourne, Florida. I am a Junior in the Bachelor's program for Computer Science at Florida Tech with a concentration in Cyber Operations. Last year, I interned in compliance at Northrop Grumman as a Cybersecurity intern. Before this, I worked for the City of Melbourne as a Recreation leader for a team in charge of managing a recreation facility and its events. </p> 
      <p>I eventually terminated my employment at the City to take an opportunity to study abroad at Oxford University in the United Kingdom. There, I made connections with fellow students, acquired skills for traversing foreign places, and, of course, studied. I was enrolled in Probability and Statistics, taught by Dr. Christina Sebu, and Science and Technical Communications, led by Dr. Agota Marton and Dr. Henry Mead.</p> 
      <p>Outside of classes, I spend a lot of time with my friends. We plan many social gatherings, such as movie nights and dinners. When I'm alone, however, I like to spend most of my time working towards skills in vulnerability research, listening to music, or occasionally watching MMA fights on the weekends.</p>
